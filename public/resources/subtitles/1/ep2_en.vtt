Oh my, miss!

Are you okay? Are you really okay?

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.500 line:85% line-align:end align:center
I hope it wasn't anything serious.
Please make sure to go to the hospital.

Ma'am, are you by any chance single?
If so, would you like to meet my dad?
5
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.200 line:85% line-align:end align:center
He's really a great person. 

6
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.200 line:85% line-align:end align:center
No, I have to go to work.

7
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.200 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Ah, okay.
I won't disturb you.
But I'm really grateful, so can we at least exchange numbers?

9
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.900 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Okay

10
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.500 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Yes.

11
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.300 line:8% line-align:end align:center
Mom, are you here?

12
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.700 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Oh, Daeho

13
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.100 line:85% line-align:end align:center
The house is so nice.
You've decorated it beautifully.

14
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.700 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Right.

15
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.000 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Serin, I bought some natural eggs
at the farmers' market this morning. 

16
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.700 line:85% line-align:end align:center
You just gave birth recently, so you need to take good care of yourself.

17
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.800 line:85% line-align:end align:center
I'll make something delicious with these for you.

18
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.200 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Oh, please stop bringing such cheap stuff.
It's dirty.
