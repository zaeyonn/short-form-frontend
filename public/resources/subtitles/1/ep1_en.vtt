Oh, Soyoung, you're here.

Which of these ladies do you like the most?

Dad doesn't care.

Hey, take a look at this.

Oh, by the way, when are you getting married?

I told you, Dad, if you don't get married, I won't get married either.

Oh my, you are impossible. Anyway, Soyoung, 
could you wait until your dad meets a decent person? 
Oh, and it would be great if you got married by then too.

It's fine. Oh, hurry up and just see the ladies' faces. I'm leaving.

Hey, hey, Soyoung.
