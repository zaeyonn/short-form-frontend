Why are you talking to mom like that?

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.600 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Ah, it's okay, it's okay.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.000 line:85% line-align:end align:center
My mom came to take care of our baby.  
She even said she'd sleep in the kitchen.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Enough. Just clean up those eggs.  
They smell and they're dirty.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.900 line:85% line-align:end align:center
And my dad is the VP of Seoul Group.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.900 line:85% line-align:end align:center
We have enough money to just hire someone.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.900 line:85% line-align:end align:center
We're just putting up with it for your mom's sake.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.800 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Honestly, I hate her looking after our baby.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.100 line:85% line-align:end align:center
I'm worried she might pass on some germs or something.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.000 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Why are you speaking so harshly?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.800 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Hey, listen to me carefully.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.700 line:85% line-align:end align:center
I sacrificed myself to marry you.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.600 line:85% line-align:end align:center
I married into your family.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.000 line:85% line-align:end align:center
If you don't like it, you and your mom can just leave.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.500 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Hey!

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.100 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Oh, it's okay. Mom.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.900 line:85% line-align:end align:center
I have somewhere to go. I'll leave now.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.700 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Mom, you even sold your house  
to help us get our own place.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.000 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Where are you going now?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.100 line:85% line-align:end align:center
No, Daeho. Chaerin just gave birth.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.000 line:85% line-align:end align:center
You shouldn't be yelling  
at your wife who just had a baby.

00:00:58.000 --> 01:00.800 line:85% line-align:end align:center
After losing Yohan, I only have you now.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.800 line:85% line-align:end align:center
All I want is for you to be happy, Daeho.

01:02.800 --> 01:07.700 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Thatâ€™s the only thing I ask for, okay?

01:08.400 --> 01:08.800 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Mom.
