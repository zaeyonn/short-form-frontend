Where should I go?

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.300 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Ma'am, this is my dad. Doesn't he look nice?

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.200 line:85% line-align:end align:center
I'll arrange for you two to meet at a restaurant. Please make sure to meet at the agreed location.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.900 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Chairman, are you really going on a blind date?

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.800 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Well, I guess I have to meet them.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.000 line:85% line-align:end align:center
How should I meet them?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000 line:85% line-align:end align:center
I should make a decision, right?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.400 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Oh? Excuse me.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.900 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Yes?

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.800 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Let me borrow those clothes.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.900 line:85% line-align:end align:center
These clothes?

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.700 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Hello, nice to meet you. Since this is a blind date, I'll be honest.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.800 line:85% line-align:end align:center
My name is Kim Hyunsoo, and I work as a janitor.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.500 line:85% line-align:end align:center
I earn about 200 a month. As you can see, my situation isn't very good.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.500 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Oh, I'm in a similar situation.

00:00:57.800 --> 01:00.000 line:85% line-align:end align:center
I work at a restaurant. I have one son, and he's married and living on his own now.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.700 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Actually, I'm looking for someone to marry.

01:02.700 --> 01:05.700 line:85% line-align:end align:center
I don't want to be a burden to my son, and it would be nice to have someone to rely on and live with.

01:05.700 --> 01:09.600 line:85% line-align:end align:center
I don't even have a car.

01:09.600 --> 01:13.000 line:85% line-align:end align:center
I live in a modest 24-pyeong villa.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.000 line:85% line-align:end align:center
I met a few people before, but they didn't seem to like it.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.300 line:85% line-align:end align:center
What's important about wealth? Living with peace of mind is what matters.

01:18.300 --> 01:20.500 line:85% line-align:end align:center
But I'm worried I might be a burden to you, Junghee.

01:20.800 --> 01:23.600 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Let's just have a meal today and part ways.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.300 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Go ahead and order.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.700 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Yes.

01:29.900 --> 01:30.900 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Oh, this is too expensive.

01:31.100 --> 01:31.400 line:85% line-align:end align:center
It's a shame. Why don't you come to our restaurant and eat?

01:33.700 --> 01:36.100 line:85% line-align:end align:center
I'll make it for you.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.500 line:85% line-align:end align:center
Yes, that's right.
